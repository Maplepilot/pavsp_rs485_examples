# Pentair VS pump / RS485 Examples
Greenfield project querying and controlling a Pentair VS pool pump over RS485 from Arduino

The above projects are based on the work of several people on dissecting Pentair's communication protocols and help from a few other people on various forums:
* Michael Rousse's pab014share sources: http://cocoontech.com/forums/files/file/173-pab014sharezip/
* Jason Young's blog post: http://www.sdyoung.com/home/pool-status/how-i-control-the-pool/
* Mark (aka rocco): http://cocoontech.com/forums/user/465-rocco/
* tagyoureit's Homebridge/node.js project: https://github.com/tagyoureit/nodejs-Pentair
